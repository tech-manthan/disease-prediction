            System

          <Typography variant="body1">
            This project focuses on building a machine learning-based predictive
            system to anticipate disease outbreaks following a natural disaster.
            After a disaster strikes‚Äîbe it floods, earthquakes, or
            cyclones‚Äîregions often experience sudden outbreaks of diseases due
            to changes in environmental and socio-economic factors.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            Our model uses historical post-disaster health and environmental
            data to predict whether a disease outbreak is likely to occur in a
            given region. The goal is to assist emergency responders and public
            health officials in proactive planning and targeted intervention,
            potentially saving lives and resources.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            After a natural disaster, healthcare systems are often overwhelmed,
            and limited resources must be used wisely. Anticipating where and
            when a disease outbreak might occur can help prioritize aid
            distribution, deploy mobile clinics, and raise early public health
            warnings. This system is designed to fill that critical gap using
            data-driven insights.
